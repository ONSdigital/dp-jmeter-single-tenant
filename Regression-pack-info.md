# Additional information for users:

This is a performance/load testing pack that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of the website holds up under a given workload. Load testing on sandbox will impact internal users as the environment may become unstable and this may slow down release velocity. Similarly, load testing on prod will affect the performance of the live site and best not to be carried out when there is a release in place. Hence before applying any load discuss with your tech lead. 

It's recommended to run the load test pack in `staging`.

This test pack when run for single user can act as a regression test.
