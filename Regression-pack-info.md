# Additional information for users:

This is a performance/load testing pack that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of the website holds up under a given workload. Load testing on sandbox will impact internal users as the environment may become instability and this may slow down release velocity. Similarly, load testing on prod will affect the performance of the live site and best not to be carried out when there is a release in place. Hence before applying any load discuss with your tech lead. 

This covers the `ONS home page` and `datasets` such as `UK trade` ,` employment labour market`, `economy`, `people population` and many others including few `cantabular census 2021`
